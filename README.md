# Fibonacci Implementations

This project showcases two approaches to calculate Fibonacci numbers: the **Iterative Approach** and the **Recursive Approach**, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.

## Comparison of Approaches

| Feature            | Iterative Approach          | Recursive Approach         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n)                       | O(2^n)                     |
| **Space Complexity**| O(1)                       | O(n) (due to call stack)   |
| **Performance**     | Efficient and fast         | Slow for large `n` values  |
| **Key Insight**     | Optimized using a sliding window | Elegant but computationally expensive |

The **iterative approach** efficiently calculates Fibonacci numbers with constant space and linear time complexity, making it ideal for larger inputs. The **recursive approach**, while elegant and simple, involves redundant calculations, which makes it inefficient for large `n`.
